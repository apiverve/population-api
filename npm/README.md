## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  country: "US",
  year: 2023
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  country: "US",
  year: 2023
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  country: "US",
  year: 2023
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "country": "US",
    "countryName": "United States",
    "year": 2025,
